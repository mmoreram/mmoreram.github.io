<div class="entry-content"><p>Well, the league of web development, in which we play, is a fussy league, I
started to recieve the first questions about the project I find myself
developing&hellip; ¿ Why a new project called Elcodi wants to cover the needs of
ecommerce when there is something similar called Sylius?</p>

<p>Although I twitt that I would write a comparison between both platforms, I
firmly believe that it is absurd to compare both of them, since Sylius is a
very mature project and has lots of features we do not have ( nor will we have
short-term ). So, this post is nothing more than a declaration of intentions
about why we have decided to start a separated project from the existing
options.</p>

<p>Firstly,  I want to mention my complete respect to Sylius. It&rsquo;s a project
builded from many different contributors, and I do not want to compare their
results with our ambition at all. I think both are two projects with two
different perspectives, and since one of our most important value ​​is humility
as a team, we start as a small project. Ambitious, but for now, small.</p>

<p>Secondly,  I want to talk with the community through what are the three basic
paws in our project. All three are equally important and we strongly believe
that one feeds the other. We are very strict on these three aspects, and  it
will remain as it is throughout the years.</p>

<h2>Event-Driven Design</h2>

<p>Elcodi is a completely event-oriented project. All components have a set of
events, especially designed to customize the behavior of a specific action.</p>

<p>Without giving importance to this point means that many people will have to fork
the project itself to implement their behavior, and this is not a good
philosophy. A third component should behave as such, giving capacity as high as
possible to be customized.</p>

<h2>Clean Code</h2>

<p>Our first and most important objective is to provide developers with a set of
useful tools for working their own implementations. We do not claim to be the
idyllic and immediate solution for all existing projects, but our goal, more or
less realistic, is to provide a completely customizable to those recurring
problems in all projects style solution.</p>

<p>For example, we can not solve all management Carta for obvious reasons: Each
project has its own unique business needs. What we can do is to propose a
simple common behavior, thus, giving the opportunity to evolve offering a
completely customizable domain model, giving the opportunity to extend the
behavior with proposed events and offering a decent and growing documentation.</p>

<p>In my view, and because realistically, the real needs are demanded by a host of
different profiles, we take care of our programming style, designing clean code,
standardizing styles and understanding everything we do. We do not position
ourselves in relation to any extreme programming philosophy, always chasing the
latest trends. We just want to create a nice project, both for developers who
want something small and stable as for those who believe that the project will
grow much.</p>

<h2>Projection executive</h2>

<p>We are a technology project, but first and foremost we are a company. This means
that even we have aspiration to be fully open source, we have a business model
behind, defined by a financial structure and economic forecasting constantly
growing.
As you can see on our website, our key role in the process is the Market. One
of the great advantages that event-driven architecture gives us is that it can
fit very easily as a decoupled processing module.</p>

<p>Actually, the point of this distinctive feature is that we do not base the
development of the project only on &ldquo;free time reviewers&rdquo; but professional people
will be responsible for developing the project, to train people interested and
manage the quality of extensions that appear on the market. A very positive
point about the scheme.</p>

<p>At the same time, the developer who wants to base its implementation on Elcodi
will have minimal confidence that there will probably be modules as solutions
to their needs. At least this is our projection, a complete win-win.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I repeat. In no time we want to compete with anyone. I understand that every
project has its trajectory. Ours is this. The collaboration between projects is
essential, and we have a strong commitment to work to collaborate with other
projects, because at last, after all, a win-win all :)</p>

<p>Coming soon we will draw a public roadmap, as well as a set of training modules
for people who want to learn some tidbits of web architecture and want to know a
little more about our project.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you want to know about project&rsquo;s updates, you can follow our
activities in <a href="http://twitter.com/elcodi_dev">Twitter &ndash; @elcodi_dev</a> or
follow our development in <a href="http://github.com/elcodi">Github &ndash; @elcodi</a>.
Obviously we want people to try, question, discuss constructively and give us
reviews on our implementations. The contributions and contributors to the
project will be well received and appreciated :)</p>
