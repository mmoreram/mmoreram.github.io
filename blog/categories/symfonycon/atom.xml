    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2014 Madrid SymfonyCon is closer every day, and I have to admit that
I admire this community. A community that has been able to feed the php world
with valuable projects and better people.</p>

<p>I admire the synergies that are created in different repositories that make
Symfony one of the best options when developing any
web project, and the entire ecosystem that has been created around, an ecosystem
very healthy and social.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll pay my own tribute the coming months.</p>

<h3>Symfony Walk 2014</h3>

<p>The goal is to walk a path to SymfonyCon Madrid with no more tools than a
backpack and good music. The principle of such route will be Zaragoza, so the
road will be a total of about 360 kilometers.</p>

<p>I will divide the challenge in 10 days plus one resting day. During the next few
days I will also define the final route and all resting points, where I will
spend nights.</p>

<p>My reasons are none other than a mixture of personal challenge of something I&rsquo;ve
wanted to do for a long time and my gratitude to this community for all
help I&rsquo;ve received indirectly.</p>

<p>As you know I work on a project called [Elcodi] (<a href="http://elcodi.io">http://elcodi.io</a>). we have
very clear which is our philosophy and the details that we care until the
last sighs of the project, and we know it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>

<p>We have overcome challenges as an <em>open source</em> project , we are overcoming
challenges as anÂ <em>open source</em> project, and hopefully over the next few years we
should overcome greater challenges as <em>open source</em> project .</p>

<p>Well, I think the act of walking for 70 hours in 10 days is a good
representation of what needs hard work, effort and time, but finally, in the
bottom of the road, a great reward awaits your arrival.</p>

<p>In my case, the conference .</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post more details about my little adventure soon.</p>
