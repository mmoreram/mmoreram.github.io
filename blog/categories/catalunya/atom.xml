    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine yourself in front of the Barcelona&rsquo;s beach in July. It sounds good,
right? Then, continue imagining yourself with a great Symfony environment, with
a very cold beer, amazing people and even better topics to talk about.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it the best plan ever?</p>

<p>Well, if you feel that you need it, then you should continue reading this
post&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very very pleased to tell you that this plan is going to happen this summer.
The Symfony Barcelona Association is working very hard on this first edition of
<a href="http://symfony.cat">Symfony Catalunya</a>, an international Symfony event placed
in our city. This event is 100% in english and is going to be very focused on
how Symfony can help us in our day by day and in our jobs.</p>

<p><a href="http://symfony.cat"><img src="http://symfony.cat/images/symfony-catalunya-poster.png" alt="Symfony Catalunya 2016" /></a></p>

<p>What does it really mean? Let me explain you properly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>0 smoke</strong>. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we will not talk about new concepts, like
React for example, but everything will be constructive and focused on your next
day work.</li>
<li><strong>New talks</strong>. Don&rsquo;t you feel that all events are populated with same talks year
after year? In this event you will find <strong>only</strong> new talks.</li>
<li><strong>Amazing speakers</strong>. Speakers are selected because their communication skills.
The speaker quality is as important as the talk quality, don&rsquo;t you think?</li>
<li>Community to Community. We will not make any money with that event. All earned
gains will be invested in you somehow.</li>
<li><strong>50 euros</strong> early bird ticket. <a href="http://symfony.cat/#tickets">Get yours</a> as soon
as possible and join us :)</li>
<li>Take some breath. 7 talks per day, one after another is never a good option.
With 4 talks per day you will be able to enjoy the city and the people.</li>
<li>Eat whatever you want, whenever you need. Your ticket doesn&rsquo;t include food,
but the venue is in front of great placed for having lunch and coffee.</li>
<li>Lighting talks. If you feel that you have something to show us, bring your 8
minutes speech.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, and because you&rsquo;re able to buy early bird tickets, we have published
4 of our 8 speakers in our website.</p>

<ul>

</ul>
