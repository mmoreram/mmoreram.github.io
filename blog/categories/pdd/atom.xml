    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about PDD for a while. Pragmatism-Driven Development, a
methodology that takes in account the development environment and the
circumstances before of deciding the tools and the architectural decisions of
your projects.</p>

<p><a href="http://mmoreram.com/blog/2014/10/26/pdd-pragmatic-driven-development-english/">Pragmatic Driver Development</a></p>

<p>Some people asked me for the manifesto. And because I think that some people
will appreciate another way of doing things more realistic, I started the first
draft of that manifesto some time ago.</p>

<p>After discussions with the ecosystem where I work, finally, I can release the
first version of the manifesto.</p>

<p>These are just some ideas, not a dogma, so please, don&rsquo;t use them as the only
way of doing things, making the same mistake again and again.</p>

<p>I will appreciate as well your constructive comments, so the real objective of
that kind of things are, indeed, to make people more comfortable with their
projects.</p>

<p>The more useful projects, the more knowledge shared, the more fun for everyone.</p>

<p>Be happy!</p>

<h2>PDD Manifesto</h2>

<h3>Good practices</h3>

<ul>
<li>All good practice is only good if it is.</li>
<li>A good practice is good, indeed, if the executor knows it enough.</li>
<li>Otherwise, a good practice becomes always a bad practice; Ipso Facto.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bad practices</h3>

<ul>
<li>All bad practice can be accepted, if, and only if, is well known by the executor.</li>
<li>Knowing them means to have a strict control of your current bad practices.</li>
<li>The absence of this control turns any bad practice in a poorly executed project.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analyzing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Every project must be analyzed according to needs and own tools.</li>
<li>Accepting that these needs and tools are static is accepting their failure.</li>
<li>Starting a project destined to fail is the worst practice of all.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Evolving</h3>

<ul>
<li>These needs can change along the time, so the tools have to change as well.</li>
<li>Internal and staff training is essential for the evolution of a team, and therefore a project.</li>
<li>All components of such team must evolve to self-acceptance and practice of good practices.</li>
</ul>
