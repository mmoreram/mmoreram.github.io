Barcelona, one of the best cities in the world.

For you, Symfony lover. Do you know where is Barcelona, right?
Well, this is a call for all Symfony lovers who want something special, 
something really different. Amazing people, amazing food and tons and tons of 
new experiences with one of the greatest Symfony Communities around the world.
