Right. Elcodi wants you.

[Elcodi Project](http://elcodi.io)

And Elcodi wants you because you are ambitious, a fighter, a ninja developer
eager to learn and to teach.

Elcodi wants you because you are a follower of good practices and have a sound
software craftsmanship mindset, because you are a perfectionist, because your
inspiring work is a way of life.


Elcodi wants you because you firmly believe that an open-source environment is a
trigger that can detonate personal and professional achievements.

We believe we are doing a good job. We are not alone in believing it, many
others do. This is why we have decided take it to the next level and start to
evolve, growing the team and our vision.

We really aim to make things the right way by unfolding the power of
collaborative software development and this is why we need your voice, your
ideas, your enthusiasm and, of course, we need your hands. Skillful, experienced
and visionary artisan hands.

If you share our vision and want to collaborate with a truly inspiring project,
