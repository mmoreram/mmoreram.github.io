Imagine yourself in front of the Barcelona's beach in July. It sounds good,
right? Then, continue imagining yourself with a great Symfony environment, with
a very cold beer, amazing people and even better topics to talk about.

Isn't it the best plan ever?

Well, if you feel that you need it, then you should continue reading this
post...

I'm very very pleased to tell you that this plan is going to happen this summer.
The Symfony Barcelona Association is working very hard on this first edition of
[Symfony Catalunya](http://symfony.cat), an international Symfony event placed
in our city. This event is 100% in english and is going to be very focused on
how Symfony can help us in our day by day and in our jobs.

What does it really mean? Let me explain you properly:

* **0 smoke**. This doesn't mean that we will not talk about new concepts, like
React for example, but everything will be constructive and focused on your next
day work.
* **New talks**. Don't you feel that all events are populated with same talks year
after year? In this event you will find **only** new talks.
* **Amazing speakers**. Speakers are selected because their communication skills.
The speaker quality is as important as the talk quality, don't you think?
* Community to Community. We will not make any money with that event. All earned
gains will be invested in you somehow.
* **50 euros** early bird ticket. [Get yours](http://symfony.cat/#tickets) as soon
as possible and join us :)
* Take some breath. 7 talks per day, one after another is never a good option.
With 4 talks per day you will be able to enjoy the city and the people.
* Eat whatever you want, whenever you need. Your ticket doesn't include food,
but the venue is in front of great placed for having lunch and coffee.
* Lighting talks. If you feel that you have something to show us, bring your 8
minutes speech.

Of course, and because you're able to buy early bird tickets, we have published
4 of our 8 speakers in our website.
