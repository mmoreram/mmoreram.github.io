The day is getting closer. I am really exited about the idea of the [Symfony Walk](http://mmoreram.com/blog/2014/08/07/symfony-walk-zaragoza-madrid/).

As you may know, the walk will consists in 12 days (10 walking, 2 resting, 1
resting day added as announced for my health), from Zaragoza to Madrid, so today
I want to announce formally the last section of the Walk, dedicated to the
people in the conference and to the entirely Symfony Community.

I want to open source the last part of my experience. I'd like everyone excited
with the idea to walk beside me for the last 38km.

That's the plan:

* From - 26 Nov at 10.00 - [Hotel Azuqueca, Azuqueca de Henares, Guadalajara](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Hotel+Azuqueca/@40.574603,-3.260397,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd424d58faf1da8d:0x4d83f8902082a9e8?hl=ca)
* To - 26 November at 19.00 - [Hotel Auditorium, Madrid](https://www.google.es/maps/search/hotel+auditorium/@40.448706,-3.5586655,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0xd4230487e9da459:0xa7e56b7dca610362?hl=ca)
* Good shoes, important!
* We could talk about symfony stuff and some interesting topics.

Excited about that? Good! Once in Madrid, a cold beer will be our best friend...
ever!

Let me know if you want to join us through the
[Eventbrite event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/symfony-walk-symfonycon-section-tickets-13728858385),
so we can organize based on the total number of people. You can also contact me
through my email, yuhu@mmoreram.com.

Looking forward to meet you there, it is going to be amazing!
