I expected it would be much easier. Indeed, it should be easier, but once again,
the effort on something is just the beginning of something simply bigger called
"The plan".

The problem is that I thought if would be much simple to sleep from Zaragoza to
Madrid.


It is not. Damn!


So this is why I will have to sleep in a sleeping bag 9 days. I don't exactly
know where will I be able to clean myself, or to eat something, or sleep. In
fact this is what OpenSource is. All OpenSource developers are Walkers in a
world without hostels, but nice people.

I expect I will find some contributors around the adventure.

- Food Pull Requests?
- Bed Pull Requests?
- Water Pull Requests?

7 days to go. I am ready. Am I?
