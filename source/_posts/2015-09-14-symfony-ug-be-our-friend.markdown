Symfony Barcelona UG have been looking some sponsors for a while, and we have
had a great response from the community. We are so proud and happy about that.

As a User Group, we want to be a community group for all the community, so from
today, you can be our UG friend :)

If you are a Symfony UG around the world and you want to be part of it, very
easy. Just send an email to
[symfonybarcelona@gmail.com](symfonybarcelona@gmail.com) or just a simple tweet
with [@symfony_bcn](http://twitter.com/symfony_bcn). We will add your logo in
our website and you will appear in our next event.

Then, we will be friends :)

Please, share this post on your social networks, and help us making a better
world with tons of tiny and cute cats :)

Have a nice week!
